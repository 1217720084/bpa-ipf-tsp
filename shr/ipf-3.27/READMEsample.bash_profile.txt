The structure of the file ".bash_profile" is slightly different for Redhat 
Linux 7.0 and 7.1, compared to previous versions 5.x and 6.x.

When you install IPF-3.27.x on systems running Redhat 7.0 or 7.1, be sure 
to use the file, "sample.bash_profile_RH7.1" to replace the default 
".bash_profile" in the /root directory, and for any user who will be 
running IPF.
