Summary of changes associated with 24-Oct-2000.tar.

1. Modified module cgetuser.c to eliminate generating " .pfo" and " .pfd"
   (blank) file names.

2. Modifed several ipf modules to implement a new option "SUMMARY=OFF" on 
   /GEN_DROP commands.  The motive is to reduce the amount of output in the 
   *.pfo files for voluminous output assocaited with PVCURVE studies.

   An example of the original and revised format follows.

   /GEN_DROP,AI_CONTROL=OFF,INITIAL_DROP=50,TOL=10
   /GEN_DROP,AI_CONTROL=OFF,SUMMARY=OFF,INITIAL_DROP=50,TOL=10


3. Revise modules srv_fcmdprs.f to rewind the *.pfo, *.pfd, and *.pff file in 
   IPFSRV following each / OLD_BASE command.  The *.pfo, *.pfd, and *.pff 
   files will reflect only the processing of the current / OLD_BASE command.

4. Revised module p_gtdata.f to remove unnecessary debug printout.

5. Installed the following modules in  /usr/bin. 

   tkdiff - a graphical text difference routine.
   launch_pf.bash - a useful utility to run bpf, consolidate any 
     user analysis, and generate geographic plots.
   dos-linux.bash - a useful utility to remove DOS-carriage returns
     from files and rename those files to lowercase. An example
     of its use is shown below.

     dos-linux.bash '*.TXT *.txt'
     dos-linux.bash '*.DAT *.dat'
