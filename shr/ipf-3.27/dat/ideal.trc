. This trace file is based on a NORMAL Winter basecase.  There is a heavy
. south to north flow across the northwest system.  The DC is set to a maximum
. import (3114 MW) and the export to BC Hydro is at its maximum of (2268 MW).
. The increased loading in the NW will be served by increased generation at
. Coulee.  The import on the COI is near zero (146 MW).
