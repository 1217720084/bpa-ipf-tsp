Summary of changes associated with 24-Oct-2000.tar.

1. Modified module cgetuser.c to eliminate generating " .pfo" and " .pfd"
   (blank) file names.

2. Modifed several ipf modules to implement a new option "SUMMARY=OFF" on 
   /GEN_DROP commands.  The motive is to reduce the amount of output in the 
   *.pfo files for voluminous output assocaited with PVCURVE studies.

   An example of the original and revised format follows.

   /GEN_DROP,AI_CONTROL=OFF,INITIAL_DROP=50,TOL=10
   /GEN_DROP,AI_CONTROL=OFF,SUMMARY=OFF,INITIAL_DROP=50,TOL=10


3. Revise modules srv_fcmdprs.f to rewind the *.pfo, *.pfd, and *.pff file in 
   IPFSRV following each / OLD_BASE command.  The *.pfo, *.pfd, and *.pff 
   files will reflect only the processing of the current / OLD_BASE command.

4. Revised module p_gtdata.f to remove unnecessary debug printout.

5. Installed the following modules in  /usr/bin. 

   tkdiff - a graphical text difference routine.
   launch_pf.bash - a useful utility to run bpf, consolidate any 
     user analysis, and generate geographic plots.
   dos-linux.bash - a useful utility to remove DOS-carriage returns
     from files and rename those files to lowercase. An example
     of its use is shown below.

     dos-linux.bash '*.TXT *.txt'
     dos-linux.bash '*.DAT *.dat'

Summary of changes associated with 26-Mar-2001

1. Eliminated all CFLOW socket calls

2. Corrected errors affecting GE->IPF import.

3. Corrected IPF_REPORTS base case comparison error - use names instead
   of numbers for the area, owner, and zone filters.

4. Added a new Fast Outage option (>NETWORK) per James Randall. This is 
   explained with an example.  
 
  > NETWORK ZONES NA,NB,NC,ND,NE,NF,NG,NH,NI,NJ,NK,PR,    BASES  30,1100.
  > NETWORK ZONES SE,TA,SP,AA,AB,AC,PD,PF,PH,WW,WX,GR,    BASES  30,1100.
  > NETWORK ZONES CC,TB,EU,JC,LK,KL,GP,CR,MD,UM,PT,WL,    BASES  30,1100.
  > NETWORK ZONES CB,CN,PW,YK,PB,MT,YR,UW,                BASES  30,1100.
  > NETWORK ZONES NA,NB,NC,ND,NE,NF,NG,NH,NI,NJ,NK,PR,    BASES  30,1100.
  > NETWORK ZONES SE,TA,SP,AA,AB,AC,PD,PF,PH,WW,WX,GR,    BASES  30,1100.
  > NETWORK ZONES CC,TB,EU,JC,LK,KL,GP,CR,MD,UM,PT,WL,    BASES  30,1100.
  > NETWORK ZONES CB,CN,PW,YK,PB,MT,YR,UW,                BASES  30,1100.
  > OUTAGE ZONES NA,                                      BASES  30,1100.
  > OVERLOAD ZONES NA,                                    BASES  30,1100.

  The > NETWORK records specify the reduced network which in this example is 
  the NORTHWEST area. Only outages and overloads in zone NA are of interest.
  However, for accuracy, the entire NORTHWEST area must be in the reduced 
  equivalent network.   

Summary of changes associated with 1-Apr-2001

1. Corrected EPC import to recognize segment names instead of zero equipment
   numbers.
   
2. Corrected EPC import to get missing bus and branch ownerships.

3. Changed EPC import to optionally obtain any of the 8 branch ratings.

4. Changed EPC import to preserve +N1, +N2, etc continuation bus types.
