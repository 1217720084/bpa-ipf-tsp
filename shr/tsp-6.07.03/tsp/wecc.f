C    %W% %G%
        subroutine wecc
c
c       This is a dummy subroutine which replaces an earlier version
c       with entry points. Those entry points are now separate 
c       subroutines, and this dummy is a quick and dirty way to
c       eliminate the original entry points in the Unix object 
c       library.
