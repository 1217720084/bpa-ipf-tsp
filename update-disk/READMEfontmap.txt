If you do an "Upgrade" installation of Redhat 7.1 over an installation of Redhat 6.2, the "fontmap" 
file for Gnumeric Spreadsheet program gets deleted.  Included here is a copy of that file, so that 
you can replace it, when you run Gnumeric and the error message says the "fontmap" file is missing.
