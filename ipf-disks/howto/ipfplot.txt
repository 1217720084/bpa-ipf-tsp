IPF Batch Plotting Program -- ipfplot

Usage:  ipfplot <coordinatefile.cor> <basefile1.bse> <basefile2.bse(opt)> <cr>

Output:  PostScript Plot file <plot.ps>

Batch plotting program to produce printed map files in PostScript (.PS)
format. The program accepts a coordinate file (.COR) and a base case file
(.BSE) on the command line, as well as an optional second base case file. When
the second base case file is specified, a difference plot is produced. You can
also use IPFPLOT to produce bubble diagrams. 

The same coordinate files (.COR) are used by both GUI and IPFPLOT, but not
all capabilities are  available in the GUI. Documentation is in the IPF
Advanced Users Guide (ipfadv.pdf).
