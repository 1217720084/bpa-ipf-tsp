The CFLOW Approach: 
Many system planning studies entail a large number of similar runs. IPS users
have encoded these standard operations in the COPE language; to do the same
sort of thing with IPF, you will use the CFLOW approach. Unlike COPE, CFLOW is
not a complete language which is interpreted by the IPF program itself.
Instead, CFLOW consists of a library of C language functions, callable from
either C or Fortran. 

To create a CFLOW program or routine, you write your routine using the C
programming language (at least the main must be in C), including the header
file cflowlib.h, which defines all the structures and unions which allow
access to the powerflow input and solution values. To retrieve these values,
you call various CFLOW routines. You can also pass modifications to IPFSRV,
ask for a new solution, etc. See the IPF CFLOW Users Guide (cflow.pdf) for
information on writing these programs.

See section 3.4 of the IPF Advanced Users Guide (ipfadv.pdf) for information on
including these routines in .PCL control files, along with other processes.
