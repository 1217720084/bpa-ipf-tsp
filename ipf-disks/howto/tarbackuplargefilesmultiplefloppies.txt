Subject:	Linux Users:  Use of "tar" for backup of large files on multiple floppies  

Use of "tar" for backup of large files on multiple floppies:

Example:  You have a large file, sample_file.out, or a group of many files, 
	sample_file1.out, sample_file2.out, etc. in a directory, /sample_directory,  
	total size 7.5-MB

First, you can use "tar" to create an "archive" of the file or group of files: 
	 
	sample_file.out.tar  

-- "tar -cvf sample_file.out.tar ./sample_file.out"  or  
-- "tar -cvf sample_directory.tar ./sample_directory"

[IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO FORMAT THE FLOPPY, BEFOREHAND]

Second, you can reduce the size of that file by using "compress" or "gzip", 
to get sample_file.out.tar.gz, total size 4.3-MB.

-- "gzip sample_file.out.tar"  or  "gzip sample_directory.tar"

Third, you can place that file on multiple floppies with the following command:  

     "tar -cvMf /dev/fd0 ./sample_file.out.tar.gz"

-- You do not need to format the floppies, and it will prompt you for each "next floppy", 
   until it is done.
-- You should label and number the floppies as they are used, in order to keep track of 
   the order.

Fourth, you can copy the file off of the multiple floppies with the following command:  

     "tar -xvMf /dev/fd0" 

-- Put in the first floppy, and follow the prompts until you are done.

If you ever want to re-use these floppies as normal formatted floppies, 
you will have to reformat them.
