	BPA POWER FLOW PROGRAM VERSION:IPF  327                     
 	Enter Power Flow Control (PFC) file name > <controlfile.pfc> <cr>

Output:  Powerflow Output file <casename.pfo>

The updated version of the old BPA batch Power Flow program. It executes using the 
commands from an old style Batch Power Flow Control (PFC) script file. 

Example of use: bpf test.pfc. 

The PFC commands (standard filename extension of .pfc) used with BPF are
scripts for a complete power flow run. Chapter 4 of the IPF Batch Users Guide
(ipfbat.pdf) describes the commands available.

The BPF Approach: 
When you use BPF, you must first create a PFC file with the appropriate commands 
to accomplish the solution task at hand. At runtime these commands are
accepted by BPF and executed according to a logical processing order
determined by the program. Hence you need not be concerned with the ordering
of commands in your PFC file. Input commands will be processed first, and a
solution done automatically before any output is produced. Finally, a new base
file will be created, if you have requested one. See the IPF Batch Users
Guide (ipfbat.pdf) for information on this approach.
