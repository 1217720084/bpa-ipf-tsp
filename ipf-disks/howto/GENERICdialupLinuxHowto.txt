PROCEDURE FOR SETTING UP AND USING A GENERIC RAS DIALUP WITH LINUX:
--------------------------------------------------------------
(Important Note:  You must first have an INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER(ISP) or 
other RAS dialup account set up for DIALUP RAS to work).

Bootup your PC in Linux (These procedures were developed to work with a system
running Redhat Linux 6.2 with "Everything" installed).

Login as root.  Run "startx" to get the Gnome Desktop.

Click the "Footprint", and go up to "Internet, Dial-Up Configuration Tool"
OR
Open a terminal window and type "rp3 &"

A window called "Create New Internet Connection" will come up.

Click "Next"

The first time you do this, a window for "finding your modem" will come up.
Follow the commands, letting the program find your modem.
(If Linux does not find your modem, it is probably a WinModem and is useless
with Linux.  You will have to buy a real modem.)

Click "Next"

A window called "Phone number and name" will come up. There will be a block for
the name, and three blocks for numbers.  In the first number block, put 1 or 9,1.
In the second block, put area code 541; and in the third block put 123-4567.

Set up the dialup account, "DIAL-RAS1" with 1 541 123-4567 or "DIAL-RAS9 with
"9,1 541 123-4567.

Click "Next"

Enter your normal ISP LAN user login ID and Password.

Click "Next"

A window called "Other Options" will come up.  Select "Normal ISP"

Click "Next"
Click "Finish"

Click the "Debug" button to connect.

You can watch the dialup progress in the dialup window that opens. You will note
that the information in the dialup window gives you the temporary IP address you
have been assigned for this session.  The "connection status" may continue to say
"Not connected" even though you really are connected -- you can ignore it".

Here is what you will see:

-------------------------------------------------------------

Once it is connected, click the Netscape Button at the bottom of your screen.

When it comes up, direct it to http://www.bpa.gov/

If this is successfull, you are now on the External BPA Web Page, and
connected to the your ISP LAN.

If this is NOT successful, see the section below on setting proxies in
Netscape Navigator, and setting Domain Name Servers (DNS).

-------------------------------------------------------------

You can now direct Netscape to ftp://ftp.bpa.gov/outgoing/ to get to
the BPA FTP Site, and you can use Shift-Click to download files.
(Netscape will automatically determine whether to use ASCII or Binary.)

Telnet Session with a RemoteHost:
Click on the Monitor Icon at the bottom of your screen to start a terminal session.
Type: "telnet RemoteHost"
Follow the login procedure with your userid and password.
When you are done, type "LO" or "lo" to logout of RemoteHost.
Type "exit" to close the terminal session.

FTP Session with a RemoteHost:
Click on the Monitor Icon at the bottom of your screen to start a terminal session.
Use "cd" to change to your local directory where you want your files to be stored.
Type: "ftp RemoteHost"
Follow the login procedure with your userid and password.
Type "ascii" or "binary" to instruct ftp what type of file you want to transfer.
Type "get" followed by the name of the file you want, e.g. "get xgui.dat".
Watch the  file transfer progress.
Use "put" in the same way, to transfer files from your PC to the RemoteHost.
When you are done, type "close" and "quit" OR type "bye", to close the session and quit ftp.
Type "exit" to close the terminal session.

When you are done:
Click the "CLOSE" button in the Dialup Progress Window, to hang up the phone connection.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Dialup-RAS Access with MOTIF/ "ipf327user" on Linux:

Once you have set up and tested the RAS Dialup above, as "root", you can then log in 
to "ipf327user" running the Motif Window Manager, and use dial-up there.

Open a terminal window, and type "rp3 &".  This will run the Internet Dialer, and will give
you choices for the various accounts you have set up, as described above.  It
has been added to the standard Fpanel Popup menu; you can do the same by
opening a terminal window,  log in as "su", and use an editor to edit the files
".fpanelrc" and "dot327.fpa".  

-------------------------------------------------------------

SETTING PROXIES FOR NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR TO WORK FROM AN INTERNAL LAN THROUGH A
FIREWALL:

For a First-Time setup of Linux RAS-Dialup on a computer that has never connected to
the LAN at the office via LAN Cable, you will need to do the following:

Run Netscape Navitgator in Linux:
Select: Edit, Preferences, 
        click on the arrow next to "Advanced", 
        click on "proxies".

Click the Button next to "Manual Proxy Configuration"
Click on "View".

In the First Four (4) sets of boxes, put in the following numbers
corresponding to the IP address of your Proxy Server (firewall):

ftp:     164.760.8.30   port 80
gopher:  164.760.8.30   port 80
http:    164.760.8.30   port 80
Secure:  164.760.8.30   port 80


In the box that says, "No Proxy For:" , type or 'copy and paste' the any names
or IP addresses for internal hosts:

;*wins.yours.com;www.yours.com;rbl;106.237.98.532;www.nwoasis.org:8080;www.nwoasis.org:8488
