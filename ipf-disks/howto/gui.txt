Users Guide (ipfgui.pdf).


The GUI Approach:
When you use the GUI approach, you use the dialog boxes, menus, windows,
etc., of the GUI. This makes data input, output, and manipulation easy. In
addition to allowing basic case solution tasks to be accomplished, certain
specialized tasks such as creating coordinate files, taking line outages
graphically, printing plots, tapping lines, viewing summary reports, and line
impedance calculations, are available. 

For information about how to work with the GUI dialog
boxes, menus, windows, etc., see the IPF Basic/GUI Users Guide. This guide
also has a tutorial to show you how to solve straightforward power system
cases.  However,for some more involved analysis tasks, you need to use the BPF, 
IPFBAT, and CFLOW  approaches.
