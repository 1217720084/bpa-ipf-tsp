Subject: IPF batch script

Gordon and John,
The attached Linux script launch_p.bas should be copied to directory 
/shr/ipf-3.27/dat and its mode changed to executable. You can use the following 
commands.

cp /mnt/floppy/launch_p.bas $(IPFDIRS)/launch_pf.bash 
chmod a+x $(IPFDIRS)/launch_pf.bash

Note that the environment variable IPFDIRS refers directory /shr/ipf-3.27/dat 
and that the DOS name was changed slightly.

I discovered that the essential plot file pfmaster.post must also reside in this 
directory, but may be located elsewhere. 

To use this script to launch a succession of IPF batch jobs to be run 
sequentially, create an executable file say submit_pf.bash with the following 
contents:

#!/bin/bash
#
# Batch submittal script
#
$(IPFDIRS)/launch_pf.bash j01cy00.pfc user.master 500bus.cor
$(IPFDIRS)/launch_pf.bash j02cy00.pfc user.master 500bus.cor
$(IPFDIRS)/launch_pf.bash j03cy00.pfc user.master 500bus.cor
$(IPFDIRS)/launch_pf.bash j04cy00.pfc user.master 500bus.cor
$(IPFDIRS)/launch_pf.bash j05cy00.pfc user.master 500bus.cor

The script expects only a single /USER_ANALYSIS, ..., OUTFILE=<outfile> record. 
If the *.pfc file contains additional /USER_ANALYSIS records, only the OUTFILE 
=<outfile> of the last record will be appended to the master. I can change the 
script if this is objectionable. The last file is optional.
