Cuts out a section of the entire system model, and prepares it to be set up for
running with its own slack bus.

This is a stand-alone program that cuts out a subsystem from a solved base
case (.BSE) file.  Flows at the cut branches are converted into equivalent
generation or load on specially formatted +A continuation bus records. An
ensuing power flow run should solve with internal branch flows and bus
voltages which are identical to those quantities in the original base case. 

In almost all cases, you will have to convert one of the buses in the cut
subsystem into a slack bus, to replace the original system slack bus (COULEE).

Several methods are available to define the cut system: bus names, zones,
base kVs, and individual branches.  A pi-back feature replaces selected buses
with a passive-node sequence (lines consisting of sections) with the original
loads pi-backed in proportion to the line admittances.

Documentation is in Appendix F of the IPF Batch Users Guide (ipfbat.pdf).
