Coordinate File Modification for Generation Studies

Discussion

For Generation Integration Studies, the use of Powerflow Plots showing proposed new generation facilities and 
associated system improvements is essential.  Generally the diagrams available are the Standard BPA 
Powerflow Plots (.COR files) developed for the Budget Cases.  Creation of new plots or modification of these 
existing .COR files is necessary to show the additional facilities.  Manual modification using a text editor is 
very time consuming and is not intuitive.  Use of the IPF GUI is a very effective way to update the poweflow 
plots with the new system information, or to create new plots from scratch.

The following step-by-step procedure is a guide to the steps necessary to create (1) an updated .COR plot file 
based on an existing Budget Case Powerflow Plot .COR file, or (2) to create a new .COR plot file from scratch 
using the IPF GUI.

Procedure

1) Modify Existing Budget Case .COR File:

Run the IPF GUI and click the appropriate "select" and "apply", and "load selections" buttons 
to load the base case file (*.BSE) already containing the added Generation and associated 
system improvements and the Budget Case coordinate file (*.COR) for the part of the system 
you are going to show. Then click the  "load selections" buttons to load them both.  Then 
“File, Save-As” to save the .COR file with a name of your choice in your user directory.  After 
that, activate the “Explode” function by clicking the 2nd Button in the 2nd Column, and click 
on the busses with the new generation and facilities you have added to the system model in the 
.BSE file.  Then, activate the “Symbol Move” function by clicking the 5th Button in the 2nd 
Column, and use the mouse to rearrange the symbols on the diagram representing the new 
generation and facilities.  When you are done, use “File, Save-As” to save your new .COR 
file.

Click  “Select” for Base Case File directory list
Click the .BSE file you want to use
Click “Apply”

Click  “Select” for Coordinate File directory list
Click the .COR file you want to use
Click “Apply”

Click “Load Selections”
After the .BSE and .COR files are loaded, click “View, Solution Data On”

Click “File, Save-As”.  
For “Coordinate”, click “Select” and enter your new name for this coordinate file.
Click “OK” , then click “Save” to save the .COR file; then click “Close”.
Procedure

2) Create New .COR File from scratch:

Run the IPF GUI and click the appropriate "select" and "apply", and "load selections" buttons 
to load the base case file (*.BSE) already containing the added Generation and associated 
system improvements and the Blank Template coordinate file (L85X11.COR or 
P85X11.COR) to show the part of the system you are going to show. Then click the  "load 
selections" buttons to load them both.  Then “File, Save-As” to save the .COR file with a 
name of your choice in your user directory.  

Activate the “Bus Input Data” function by clicking the 6th Button in the 1st Column.  The 
cursor will change from an arrow to an open square.  Close the “Bus Input Data” window.  
Click “Edit, Alpha List”  to bring up a list of all the busses in the .BSE case.  Now select the 
bus you will use to start the diagram.  Click in the “Search Bus Name kV” window and with 
“CapsLock” on, type in the 1st letter of the bus name, then the 2nd, etc. until the bus name 
appears in the list.  Select the desired bus and click “Close”.  Then, with the mouse, locate the 
1st bus at the appropriate location on the blank diagram, and click to place it there.

After that, activate the “Explode” function by clicking the 2nd Button in the 2nd Column, and 
click on the busses with the new generation and facilities you have added to the system model 
in the .BSE file.  Then, activate the “Symbol Move” function by clicking the 5th Button in the 
2nd Column, and use the mouse to rearrange the symbols on the diagram representing the new 
generation and facilities.  When you are done, use “File, Save-As” to save your new .COR 
file.

Click  “Select” for Base Case File directory list
Click the .BSE file you want to use
Click “Apply”

Click  “Select” for Coordinate File directory list
Click the .COR file you want to use
Click “Apply”

Click “Load Selections”
After the .BSE and .COR files are loaded, click “View, Solution Data On”

Click “File, Save-As”.  
For “Coordinate”, click “Select” and enter your new name for this coordinate file.
Click “OK” , then click “Save” to save the .COR file; then click “Close”.
