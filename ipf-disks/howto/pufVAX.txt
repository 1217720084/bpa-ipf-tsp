Subject: Path Use Factors
A new version of Path Use Factors (aka Line Flow Analysis) resides on HAL in 
directory on disk25:[psap.ipf]. It corrects a factorization error and introduces 
new command-line options. 
To execute this program from the BPA80 cluster, define a variable with the 
command
$ PUFNSTUFF :== "$disk25:[psap.ipf]pufnstuff.exe_v327"
and invoke it with the command
$ PUFNSTUFF [-x|] [-lossless] [-pv] [-ai] [-g] [-ps] [-p1] [-c <cutfile>]
where the parameters enclosed in square brackets [...] are optional. The 
parameters are
-x<flag> : defines an Excel field separation character. <flag> is usually set to 
"|" (vertical bar).
-pv : sets all buses as PV. Default is PV and PQ.
-ai : sets area interchange control on. Default is off.
-g : restricts sensitivities to generator buses only. Default is all buses.
-ps : includes phase-shifter sensitivities. Default excludes phase shifter 
sensitivities.
-lossless : formulates the lossless sensitivities and should be used in 
conjunction with -pv option.
(the lossless formulation minimizes the affect of slack bus location). Default 
uses full Jacobian 
-l1 : sensitivities expressed as dLine/dP (default)
-l2 : sensitivities expressed as 1.0 + dLine/dP.
-c <cutfile> : constrain the flow path with the cut system defined by cutting 
commands in <cutfile>.
From my tests, I recommend the single parameter:
$ PUFNSTUFF -x|
You will be prompted for three files:
    basecase file name 
    output file name 
    flowgate file name
The flowgate file name consists of WSCC-formatted branches which define a 
particular cut plane. For my tests, I've used a single but critical branch:
