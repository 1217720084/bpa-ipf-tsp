Building the IPF suite of programs.

1. Download the files ipf-3.24.tar.gz, .bash_profile, and XGUI into directory /shr.  If you download into some other directory, you will have to change several *.c, *.bash, .bash_profile, and XGUI files.

   gunzip ipf-3.24.tar.gz
   tar -xvf ipf-3.24

   This will create subdirectories ipf-3.24.  (If this direcotry already exists, you should first rename the older directory to something like ipf-3.24.old.)

2. Create all libraries.

   cd ipf-3.24
   cd /ipf
   ./build_libipf.bash
   cd ../ipc
   ./build_libipc.bash
   cd ../gui
   ../build_libgui.bash

3. Create all executables

   cd ../exe
   make -f ipfsrv.make            #! This makes the server ipf
   make -f gui.make               #! This makes the client GUI

   The other executables you could make, but are not necessary to a basic gui, are

   make -f bpf.make               #! This makes the batch ipf, useful to those
                                     who prefer launching powerflow studies from
                                     scripts
   make -f netdat.make            #! This makes the network extraction program
                                     (exports to PTI's PSS/E versions 23/24 and to
                                     GE's PSLF, versions 10/11
   make -f ipf_reports.make       #! A very popular interactive program to examining
                                     a base case

4. Do the following into the root directories of all users who will execute the GUI: 

   cd ${HOME}
   cp /shr/ipf-3.24/XGUI .
   
and edit the .bash_profile file to include the definitions for UIDPATH, RUN_IPFSRV,  and IPFDIRS.  

You will have to logout/login to make these changes effective on all terminal windows.

5. To execute the GUI,  

   cd to your data directory
   /shr/ipf-3.24/exe/gui

   To execute the batch ipf using the example test case TESTDC3.PFC,

   cd /shr/ipf-3.24/dat
   ../exe/bpf TESTDC3.PFC

IPF is in the public domain and certain conditions apply.  
The terms in which it is released are described in the section "Notice to Non BPA Users" in each of the IPF manuals.
